<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a revamped version of a Tic-Tac-Toe game originally created by a YouTuber. I redesigned it with a fresh and stylish look using my own CSS to enhance the user experience. The game retains its classic mechanics while featuring a polished design, to make it more enjoyable to play. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, this project was a practice of my CSS skills. 

<!-- HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM -->
##  Run
Since this project is not yet hosted online, you can run it locally using **Visual Studio Code's Live Server:**

<!-- HOW TO PLAY -->
##  How To Play
1. Click on an empty square to make your move.
2. Players take turns placing their 'X' or 'O' in any available square.
3. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
